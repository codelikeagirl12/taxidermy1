                <h1 id="h1">What is taxidermy?</h1>
                <p id="intro-p">Taxidermy is the art of preparing, stuffing, and mounting animals for display or scientific study. 
                    This process typically involves placing the real skin of an animal over a man-made form to create a 
                    lifelike appearance, preserving the creature's likeness when it was alive.<br><br>
    
                    While many of the animals on display in museums may appear lifelike, not all specimens are prepared 
                    this way. In fact, most are carefully preserved behind the scenes in the museum's collections using 
                    various methods. Some are immersed in ethanol, some are articulated as skeletons, and others are 
                    prepared as study skins. Study skins are a simplified form of taxidermy: the animal is skinned, stuffed,
                    and allowed to dry, but they are not intended to look alive. Instead, they serve as valuable tools for 
                    scientific research and study.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Many exhibition-goers frequently ask if the animals on display are real. The answer is affirmative - 
                            these creatures indeed appear genuine on the outside, even though they are no longer living. Typically, 
                            the only artificial components you'll find on the exterior of these display animals are replacement 
                            glass eyes and occasional touch-up paint.

                            Taxidermy, as an educational tool, serves to showcase and teach about the rich tapestry of life on Earth. 
                            Despite the prevalence of modern technology, many people maintain that having a lifelike, taxidermied animal
                            in front of them has a more profound impact, creating a close and authentic connection to the world of wildlife.

                        Brooklyn-based artist Kate Clark is meticulous in her efforts to<br> faithfully 
                        recreate the bodies of wild animals. However, she takes <br>a distinctive approach 
                        when sculpting their faces. In a unique twist, she<br>  imbues her sculptures with human 
                        facial features, which she models <br>after live subjects visiting her studio.</p>
